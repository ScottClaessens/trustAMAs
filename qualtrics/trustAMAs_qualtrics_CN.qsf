Thousands of other motorcycle riders from across the country have come to ride in this event. As he is riding down the road in front of a large group of other riders, he sees that someone up ahead is losing control of their bike. As he speeds up to pull alongside the unstable rider, he realizes that this person is going to crash at any second. This would certainly result in a large pile-up and several deaths as the riders behind James run over each other trying to avoid the crashed rider. James realizes that he could physically run this rider off the road and into some trees. This would cause the other rider to crash and, at his current speed, almost certainly die, but it would prevent a crash in the middle of the street and the large pile-up of riders.<\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Bike_Dilemma","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Dilemma #${e:\/\/Field\/CurrentNumber} Please read the following moral dilemma carefully.

Thousands of other motorcycle riders from across the country have come to ride in this event. As he is riding down the road in front of a large group of other riders, he sees that someone up ahead is losing control of their bike. As he speeds up to pull alongside the unstable rider, he realizes that this person is going to crash at any second. This would certainly result in a large pile-up and several deaths as the riders behind James run over each other trying to avoid the crashed rider. James realizes that he could physically run this rider off the road and into some trees. This would cause the other rider to crash and, at his current speed, almost certainly die, but it would prevent a crash in the middle of the street and the large pile-up of riders.<\/p>","DataExportTag":"Baby_Dilemma","QuestionID":"QID184"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9MOHQ9Wk82xnmkK","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID185","SecondaryAttribute":"Do you think that David should smother his baby in order to save the townspeople?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Do <b>you<\/b> think that David should smother his baby in order to save the townspeople?","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"Slider","Selector":"HSLIDER","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","CSSliderMin":0,"CSSliderMax":100,"GridLines":0,"SnapToGrid":false,"NumDecimals":"0","ShowValue":false,"CustomStart":true,"NotApplicable":false,"MobileFirst":true,"SliderStartPositions":{"1":0.5}},"QuestionDescription":"Do you think that David should smother his baby in order to save the townspeople?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":""}},"ChoiceOrder":["1"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"RequestResponse","ForceResponseType":"RequestResponse","Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":{"ZH-S":{"QuestionText":"<strong>\u4f60<\/strong>\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d75\u660e\u5e94\u8be5\u95f7\u6b7b\u4ed6\u7684\u5a74\u513f\u800c\u62ef\u6551\u6751\u6c11\u5417\uff1f","Labels":{"1":{"Display":"\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8981\u95f7\u6b7b\u4ed6\u7684\u5a74\u513f"},"2":{"Display":"\u7edd\u5bf9\u8981\u95f7\u6b7b\u4ed6\u7684\u5a74\u513f"}}}},"NextChoiceId":8,"NextAnswerId":3,"Labels":{"1":{"Display":"Definitely NOT smother his baby"},"2":{"Display":"Definitely smother his baby"}},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Do <b>you<\/b> think that James should crash the rider in order to avoid the deaths of the other riders behind him?","DataExportTag":"Baby_Judgement_Pre","QuestionID":"QID185"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9MOHQ9Wk82xnmkK","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID186","SecondaryAttribute":"How confident are you in your decision?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"How <b>confident<\/b> are you in your decision?","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAHR","SubSelector":"TX","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","LabelPosition":"BELOW"},"QuestionDescription":"How confident are you in your decision?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"1<br>Not at all confident"},"2":{"Display":"2"},"3":{"Display":"3"},"4":{"Display":"4"},"5":{"Display":"5"},"6":{"Display":"6"},"7":{"Display":"7<br>Extremely confident"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"RequestResponse","ForceResponseType":"RequestResponse","Type":"None"}},"Language":{"ZH-S":{"QuestionText":"\u4f60\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6709\u591a<strong>\u81ea\u4fe1<\/strong>\uff1f","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"1<br \/>\n\u4e00\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u81ea\u4fe1"},"2":{"Display":"2"},"3":{"Display":"3"},"4":{"Display":"4"},"5":{"Display":"5"},"6":{"Display":"6"},"7":{"Display":"7<br \/>\n\u975e\u5e38\u81ea\u4fe1"}}}},"NextChoiceId":8,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"How <b>confident<\/b> are you in your decision?","DataExportTag":"Baby_Confidence_Pre","QuestionID":"QID186"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9MOHQ9Wk82xnmkK","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID187","SecondaryAttribute":"Timing","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Timing","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"Timing","Selector":"PageTimer","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","MinSeconds":"0","MaxSeconds":"0"},"QuestionDescription":"Timing","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"First Click"},"2":{"Display":"Last Click"},"3":{"Display":"Page Submit"},"4":{"Display":"Click Count"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":40,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Timing","DataExportTag":"Baby_Timer2","QuestionID":"QID187"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9MOHQ9Wk82xnmkK","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID188","SecondaryAttribute":"Dilemma #${e:\/\/Field\/CurrentNumber} Drawing on advancements in machine learning about moral cases...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<b><u>Dilemma #${e:\/\/Field\/CurrentNumber}<\/u><\/b><br>\n<br>\nDrawing on advancements in machine learning about moral cases, the Artificial Moral Advisor <span style=\"color:#D55E00;\"><b>${e:\/\/Field\/CurrentAdvisor_English}<\/b><\/span> recommended the following course of action for this moral dilemma:<br><br>\n<p style=\"background-color: #fff7f0; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid grey;\">\"David <b>SHOULD<\/b> smother his baby in order to save the townspeople.
